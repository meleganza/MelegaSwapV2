# LB002 — Liquidity Building UI Contract & Domain Model

**Status:** FROZEN (V1 product contract)  
**Mission:** LB002 — documentation only  
**Depends on:** `docs/LB001_LIQUIDITY_BUILDING_REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md`  
**Branch baseline:** `main` @ `8489eeacd7c4bfa05d00a7fe1046733093236407`  
**Scope:** UI contract, domain model, glossary, state machines, metrics, copy — **no application code**

---

## 0. Purpose and non-goals

This document is the single frozen specification for Liquidity Building V1. Subsequent smart-contract, runtime, and frontend missions must conform to it.

**Does:** close product-domain gap **LB-G01** (no Liquidity Building domain).  
**Does not:** resolve **LB-G02**, **LB-G03**, **LB-G04**, **LB-G07** (carried forward as Known External Blockers).

**Forbidden foundations:** Pancake stale router at `packages/smart-router/evm/constants/exchange.ts:10` must not be used as Liquidity Building design basis. Melega Router/Factory from LB001 are canonical.

---

## 1. Frozen product positioning

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | **Liquidity Building** |
| Public definition | Transform your project’s token reserve into real liquidity, automatically and progressively. |
| Short description | Use your available token supply to build liquidity from real market demand. |
| Destination | Melega DEX → Liquidity Studio → Liquidity Building |
| Placement | New `LsPanel` in `AreaRight` after AI Advisor — `LiquidityStudioScreen.tsx:200-207` |

**Not:** buyback, price support, growth guarantee, market making, price manipulation, separate platform, new dashboard, multi-DEX (V1).

---

## 2. Non-negotiable decisions (already approved)

### 2.1 Configuration fields (owner-editable)

1. Token  
2. Token Budget  
3. Strategy  
4. Epoch Duration  

DEX, pair, quote asset, pool liquidity, LP ownership, fee, and protections are **detected or protocol-determined** (read-only in setup).

### 2.2 Strategy

| Mode | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Full AI — Recommended** | Default. Engine decides whether to execute and how much within protocol safety limits. |
| **Dynamic Range** | Owner sets only `minimumRate` and `maximumRate`. Engine picks effective rate inside range. |

`protocolStrategyCeiling` is **not** invented here; closed in LB003+.

Validation semantics:

```
minimumRate > 0
maximumRate >= minimumRate
maximumRate <= protocolStrategyCeiling   // ceiling TBD later
```

### 2.3 Epoch duration

| Label | Canonical seconds | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 minutes | `300` | **Yes** |
| 15 minutes | `900` | |
| 30 minutes | `1800` | |
| 1 hour | `3600` | |

### 2.4 Fee

**5% success fee on quote assets acquired through Liquidity Building.**

```
melegaFee = grossQuoteAcquired × 500 / 10_000
```

Rounding policy: **required to be closed in smart-contract mission** (not fixed here).

Fee **does not** apply to: deposit, unused budget, epochs with no successful quote acquisition.  
Fee is **not** taken in project token. Separate from gas, swap fee, slippage.  
Settles only after real quote acquisition via canonical Treasury Runtime / D99 path (integration still blocked by LB-G04).

### 2.5 LP ownership

Default: **Owner-controlled liquidity**, **Unlocked**.  
Initial LP recipient: authenticated project owner.  
Lock: optional, post-activation.

### 2.6 Program end

Continues until: budget depleted | owner stop | owner pause | safety pause | blocking error.  
No mandatory liquidity target or end date in V1.

## 3. Existing repository evidence (reuse justification)

| Finding | File | Lines | Existing behavior | LB002 decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Card insertion point | `apps/web/src/views/LiquidityStudio/LiquidityStudioScreen.tsx` | 200-207 | `AreaRight` stacks Market + Advisor `LsPanel`s | Insert LB card as third sibling after Advisor |
| Panel primitive | `.../liquidityStudioPrimitives.tsx` | 9-34, 36-44 | `LsPanel`, `LsPanelTitle` | Reuse for LB card shell |
| Badge pattern | `liquidityStudioPrimitives.tsx` | 55-70 | `LsPreviewBadge` | Reuse for status / AI Powered badges |
| Primary CTA | `liquidityStudioPrimitives.tsx` | 72-76 | `LsPrimaryBtn` | Primary actions |
| Connect wallet CTA | `LiquidityBuilderPanel.tsx` | 364, 430 | `ConnectWalletButton` when disconnected | Same pattern for LB when wallet required |
| Phase / error model | `useLiquidityMintRuntime.tsx` | 57-101, 273-304 | Runtime phase + error object | Separate `TransactionPhase` from program state |
| Activity rows | `LiquidityActivityTable.tsx` | ~223 | Status cell | Inform LB Activity model |
| LP submit deferral | `lib/liquidity-runtime/lpSubmitDeferral.ts` | 16-21 | Direct wallet router; ingress unsupported | Document as LB-G02; do not pretend ingress owns LB |
| Implicit pair create | LB001 + `AddLiquidity/index.tsx` | 241-276 | First `addLiquidity*` creates pair | No-pool CTA = seed add-liquidity path, not fake `createPair` |
| LP recipient today | `AddLiquidity/index.tsx` | 259, 273 | Recipient = connected `account` | LB default recipient = owner; must be program-bound later |
| Stale Pancake router | `packages/smart-router/evm/constants/exchange.ts` | 10 | BSC = Pancake `0x10ED43…` | LB-G07; never design LB against it |
| Chain page gate | `pages/liquidity-studio.tsx` | 6 | `SUPPORT_MULTI_CHAINS` | Wrong-chain UX: Switch Network |
| AI Advisor panel | `AILiquidityAdvisorPanel.tsx` | 58-93 | Right-rail `LsPanel` | Visual sibling for LB card |

---

## 4. Known External Blockers (carried forward)

| ID | Current status | Effect on UI/domain contract | Required later mission |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LB-G02 | Open — LP deferred from execution-ingress | UI must not claim ingress-executed LP; activation path remains program-defined | Runtime/contract architecture |
| LB-G03 | Open — KERL non-broadcast; no LB executor | “AI Powered” is capability copy, **not** proof an executor is live; hide execution CTAs until cutover | Bounded executor mission |
| LB-G04 | Open — Treasury fee/quote not machine-integrated | Fee shown as protocol fact; settlement status may be `unavailable` | Treasury binding mission |
| LB-G07 | Open — stale Pancake router in smart-router package | LB domain forbids that address as Melega destination | Package alignment / import audit |

Documenting LB002 **does not** resolve these blockers.

## 6. UI information architecture

**Route:** `/liquidity-studio` only — no new route.  
**Shell:** new `LsPanel` in `AreaRight` after `AILiquidityAdvisorPanel`.

### 6.1 Textual wireframes (content hierarchy)

**Common mobile behavior:** card stacks in right-rail flow; primary CTA full-width (`LsPrimaryBtn` pattern); secondary actions as outline/ghost; long metrics wrap; explorer links open externally.

#### 1) Inactive card
```
[Liquidity Building]     [AI Powered] [Not Active]
Use your available token supply to build liquidity from real market demand.
• Budget-based execution
• Dynamic AI strategy
• Automatic Melega DEX liquidity
• Owner-controlled LP
[Start Building Liquidity]
```
Primary: Start. Hidden: Pause/Manage/Activity until activated path.

#### 2) Token selected
Shows token metadata + compatibility verdict + detected pair summary. Primary: Continue. Secondary: Change token.

#### 3) Setup required
Four fields wizard (Token → Budget → Strategy → Epoch) + read-only auto panel. Primary: Review / Continue.

#### 4) No pool detected (`SETUP_REQUIRED` / `NO_MELEGA_POOL`)
```
No Melega DEX pool detected
Create a standard Melega DEX pool before activating Liquidity Building.
[Create Pool & Continue]
```
Read-only: recommended quote, seed guidance placeholders (no fake amounts), steps list.

#### 5) Awaiting approval
Primary: Approve Token. Show TransactionPhase. Secondary: Cancel setup (if allowed).

#### 6) Awaiting deposit
Primary: Deposit Budget (or Deposit Budget & Start when activation combined). Multi-tx progress honest.

#### 7) Ready
Program configured & funded; not yet ACTIVE. Primary: Activate / Start (if separate). Or already combined into deposit path.

#### 8) Active
See §12 Active card contract.

#### 9) Paused (owner)
Banner: Paused by owner. Primary: Resume. Manage available.

#### 10) Safety paused
Banner: Liquidity Building paused for safety + reason. Resume only when clearable.

#### 11) Budget depleted
Status BUDGET_DEPLETED. Primary: Add Budget or Stop/Withdraw per rules. No execution CTAs.

#### 12) Stopped
Terminal. View Activity. No Pause/Resume.

#### 13) Error
Status ERROR + reason. Primary: Retry if retryable; else Manage/Stop.

#### 14) Activity view
Timeline (§21). Filter: all / owner txs / executions / safety.

#### 15) Manage view
§13 Manage contract.

**Risk messages:** never “guaranteed liquidity growth”, “support the price”, “risk-free”.

**Wallet disconnected:** replace primary with Connect Wallet (Builder pattern).  
**Wrong chain:** Switch Network.  
**Runtime unavailable:** show copy; do not invent metrics; keep program state; TransactionPhase IDLE.

---

## 7. Inactive card contract (frozen)

**Order / emphasis:**

1. Title: Liquidity Building (display typography / `LsPanelTitle`)  
2. Badges: `AI Powered` (capability), `Not Active` (status)  
3. Body definition sentence  
4. Four capability bullets (not live metrics)  
5. Primary CTA: **Start Building Liquidity**

| Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Wallet disconnected | CTA → Connect Wallet; setup blocked |
| Wrong chain | CTA → Switch Network |
| Runtime unavailable | CTA disabled or “Temporarily unavailable”; no fake Active |

**AI Powered** ≠ live executor proof (LB-G03).

---

## 8. Setup flow (four fields)

### Step 1 — Token
Copy: **Select or paste token address**

Auto-detected: address, name, symbol, decimals, total supply, wallet balance, detected pair, detected quote asset, current pool liquidity, **token compatibility verdict**.

### Step 2 — Token Budget
Copy: **How many tokens do you want to dedicate?**  
Support: **Only the deposited budget can be used. Unused tokens remain withdrawable.**

Validation: amount > 0; ≤ wallet balance; raw base units; decimals respected; Max fills balance; insufficient balance blocks; allowance required before deposit; **fee-on-transfer → reject** (`FEE_ON_TRANSFER_DETECTED`).

### Step 3 — Strategy
- Full AI — Recommended (default)  
- Dynamic Range (min/max rates; ceiling TBD)

Copies per §2.2.

### Step 4 — Epoch Duration
Options: 5m (default), 15m, 30m, 1h → `300|900|1800|3600`.

---

## 9. Automatic read-only information

| Field | Available | Loading | Pair missing | RPC down | Unverifiable | Unsupported token |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Liquidity destination | Melega DEX (canonical) | skeleton | still Melega | still Melega | “Unverified” | hide activation |
| Detected pair | address/link | skeleton | “No pool detected” | “Unavailable” | “Unverified” | n/a |
| Quote asset | symbol/address | skeleton | recommendation only | Unavailable | Unverified | n/a |
| Current pool liquidity | reserves-derived | skeleton | “—” | Unavailable | Unverified | n/a |
| Strategy protection | protocol limits label | — | — | — | “Limits pending ratification” if ceiling unset | — |
| LP ownership | Owner-controlled | — | — | — | — | — |
| LP recipient | owner address | — | — | — | — | — |
| Melega success fee | 5% of acquired quote | — | — | — | — | — |
| Program end | budget/stop/pause/safety/error | — | — | — | — | — |

**No simulated numbers.**

---

## 10. Review contract

Show before activation: project token, budget, strategy (+ range), epoch, destination, pair, quote, pool liquidity, LP recipient, LP status (Unlocked), fee, end condition, **required transaction sequence**.

CTA: **Deposit Budget & Start**

Honest multi-tx: Approve (if needed) → Deposit → Activate (may merge deposit+activate on-chain later; UI must not fake atomicity if separate).

---

## 11. No-pool flow

Program state: `SETUP_REQUIRED`  
Reason: `NO_MELEGA_POOL`

Copy:

- **No Melega DEX pool detected**  
- Create a standard Melega DEX pool before activating Liquidity Building.

CTA: **Create Pool & Continue**

Meaning (aligned with LB001 implicit create):

```
quote recommendation → seed calculation → approval → initial addLiquidity
→ pair confirmation → return to Liquidity Building setup
```

**Do not** promise a standalone `createPair` transaction.

Read-only (values produced later by live math — **no amounts frozen here**):

- recommended quote asset (USDT | WBNB | USDC if fully supported)  
- minimum viable seed (TBD)  
- recommended seed (TBD)  
- initial LP recipient (owner)  
- expected steps list  

---

## 12. Program state machine

### 12.1 ProgramStatus (exact)

`NOT_ACTIVE` | `SETUP_REQUIRED` | `AWAITING_APPROVAL` | `AWAITING_DEPOSIT` | `READY` | `ACTIVE` | `PAUSED` | `SAFETY_PAUSED` | `BUDGET_DEPLETED` | `STOPPED` | `ERROR`

### 12.2 TransactionPhase (separate)

`IDLE` | `SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` | `SUBMITTED` | `PENDING` | `CONFIRMING` | `SUCCEEDED` | `FAILED` | `REPLACED` | `CANCELLED`

TransactionPhase **must not** be stored as ProgramStatus.

```

| Metric priority | Unit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Liquidity built | dual base units | Never simulated USD |
| 2 Budget remaining | project token base | Exclude reserved pending |

## 18. Safety pause vs owner pause

| | PAUSED | SAFETY_PAUSED |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who | Owner | Protocol/runtime |
| New executions | No | No |
| Unused budget | Per protocol rules | Per protocol rules |
| Reason code | optional owner note | **mandatory** |
| Resume | Owner anytime (if not also safety) | Only after condition cleared & verified |
| Copy | Paused by owner | **Liquidity Building paused for safety** |

Skipped epoch ≠ safety pause.

## 19. Domain model

### LiquidityBuildingProgram
`programId`, `chainId` (56 V1), `owner`, `projectToken`, `quoteAsset`, `pair`, `strategy`, `epochDurationSeconds`, `programStatus`, `createdAt`, `activatedAt`, `pausedAt`, `stoppedAt`, `currentEpoch`, `lpRecipient`, `safetyState`

### TokenBudget
`initialDepositedBudget`, `addedBudget`, `totalDepositedBudget`, `remainingBudget`, `reservedForPendingExecution`, `tokensSold`, `tokensMatchedIntoLP`, `withdrawnUnusedBudget`

**Invariant:**

```
remaining + reserved + tokensSold + tokensMatched + withdrawnUnused
  = totalDeposited
```

(± explicitly accounted rounding residuals)

### StrategyConfig

### EpochState
`epochId`, `start`, `end`, `observationFinalized`, `decisionStatus`, `executionStatus`, `executionId`, `skipReason`, `executionCount`

### FlowObservation
observed/excluded/eligible buys & sells, `eligibleNetBuyFlow`, block range, evidence source

### ExecutionDecision
`decisionId`, `epochId`, `decisionType` ∈ {`EXECUTE`,`EXECUTE_IN_TRANCHES`,`WAIT`,`SKIP`,`SAFETY_PAUSE`}, `effectiveStrategyRate`, intended sale/acquisition, max price impact, slippage, deadline, reason, `strategyEngineVersion`, `onChainValidationStatus`

## 20. Authority separation

```
Observed market flow
→ Eligible flow classification
→ Strategy decision          (AI may propose)
→ On-chain bounded validation
→ Execution trigger
→ Transaction execution
→ Receipt verification
→ Accounting
```

Rules:

- AI proposes; does not set recipient/fee/budget/limits  
- Economic limits enforced on-chain  
- Executor has **no free economic discretion**  
- Same epoch cannot execute twice (`EPOCH_ALREADY_EXECUTED`)  
- Internal LB operations excluded from observed eligible flow  
- No human operational wallet in the model  
- Owner controls program; cannot rewrite history  

Executor choice (permissionless vs worker) deferred to architecture mission — **not** decided here.

## 21. Metric contract and formulas

| Metric | Formula / rule | Source class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Token Budget | First confirmed deposit | on-chain authoritative |
| Added Budget | Σ later deposits | on-chain |
| Total Deposited | initial + added | derived |
| Remaining | available excl. reserved pending | on-chain/accounting |
| Tokens Sold | successful swap consumed | receipt-derived |
| Tokens Matched | successful add-liq project token | receipt-derived |
| Gross Quote Acquired | swap received | receipt/event/balance delta |
| Melega Fee Paid | `gross × 500 / 10000` (+ rounding TBD) | settlement |
| Net Quote Available | gross − fee | derived |
| Net Quote Added | quote in successful add-liq | receipt |
| Liquidity built | **dual:** tokensMatched + netQuoteAdded | receipt |
| LP Received | LP delta to recipient | receipt/event |

Aggregated “value” in quote terms only if derived from **successful add-liquidity ratio**, never from simulated mid price.

| pool liquidity | pair reserves | getReserves | — | very short | mark stale | “Unavailable” |
| eligibleNetBuyFlow | observation+classification | evidence refs | derived w/ evidence | epoch | epoch-bound | hide or “Not ready” |
| nextEligibleEpoch | schedule | time/blocks | derived | no long | — | time only; no promise |
| AI decision detail | decision record | validation status | engine | — | — | presentation-only extras |

Never permanent SoT: local optimistic UI state alone.
