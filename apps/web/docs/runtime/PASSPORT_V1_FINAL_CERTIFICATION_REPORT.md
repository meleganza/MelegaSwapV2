# PASSPORT V1 — Final Integration & Certification

## Executive Summary

MARCO Passport V1 (modules **001–007**) is sealed as a production-quality, honesty-first identity and account layer on `/passport`. This mission performed **integration validation, freeze locking, multi-viewport measurement, accessibility/performance/deeplink audits, documentation, and tests** only. No new features, geometry redesigns, routes, APIs, or production mock data were introduced.

**Verdict: PASSPORT_V1_CERTIFIED**

## Architecture

- **Route:** `/passport` → `PassportScreen`
- **Order:** Hero/Identity → Portfolio → Assets → Projects → Liquidity → Bottom grid (Activity | Security) → Command Center (connected) or guest bridge
- **Visual SoT:** Founder-approved mockup (Architecture 000), byte-identical
- **Product name:** MARCO Passport (nav: Passport)
- **Dual surface (documented):** When a wallet is connected, certified Passport modules remain above the existing `CommandCenterScreen` until a future cutover — not redesigned in this seal

## Frozen Modules

| Module | Name | Freeze |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 001 | Hero & Identity | SHA locked |
| 002 | Portfolio Overview | SHA locked |
| 003 | Assets | SHA locked |
| 004 | My Projects | SHA locked |
| 005 | Liquidity Positions | SHA locked |
| 006 | Recent Activity | SHA locked |
| 007 | Security | SHA locked |

Lock file: `apps/web/src/views/PassportStudio/__tests__/passportV1.final.freeze.sha256.json`  
**46** owned implementation files + shared `PassportScreen.tsx` + `passportTokens.ts`.

Evidence: `passport-v1-final-certification/module-freeze.json`

## Integration Validation

Guest → Connect → Identity → Portfolio → Assets → Projects → Liquidity → Activity → Security verified via:

- Mount-order unit test
- `data-passport-module-001` … `007` = `mounted` in live DOM
- Independent module builders (one source failure does not collapse siblings)

## Performance

- Navigation timing captured in `performance.json`
- Notes: independent `useAccount` per module (expected); `usePassportHeroIdentity` used by Hero + Security (documented duplicate — not changed to preserve freeze); no new lazy APIs; no bundle-behavior changes in this mission

## Accessibility

- Semantic `section` / headings across modules
- Status text on badges (not color-only)
- Gold focus rings on CTAs
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected in module CSS
- Evidence: `accessibility.json`

## Responsive

Validated viewports: **1440**, **1024**, **430**, **390**. No page-level horizontal overflow. Evidence: `responsive.json`, screenshots.

## Deep Links

| Destination | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | OK |
| `/passport` | OK |
| `/list?intent=create-project` | OK |
| `/swap` | OK |
| `/liquidity-studio?view=positions\|add\|building` | OK |
| `/command-center` | OK (exists; Activity View All remains null in production) |

Evidence: `deeplinks.json`

## Data Integrity

- **M-Credits** remain a separate service-payment concept (never ERC-20 inventory)
- **Projects** never inferred from token holdings
- **Liquidity** double-count policy: LB summary wins same-pair overlap
- **Activity / Security** sessions-recovery-alerts unavailable honestly when producers missing
- Modules never contradict via fabricated shared totals — unavailable fields stay `—` / Unavailable independently

## Evidence

`apps/web/docs/runtime/passport-v1-final-certification/`

- `desktop-full.png`, `tablet.png`, `mobile.png`, `mobile-430.png`, `overlay.png`
- `geometry.json`, `performance.json`, `responsive.json`, `accessibility.json`, `deeplinks.json`, `module-freeze.json`
- `certify.mjs`

## Remaining Honest Limitations

1. No Passport identity profile / KYC API → never live “Verified” without fixtures  
2. Portfolio / Assets USD & M-Credits ledger largely unavailable  
3. No durable Passport activity feed → production empty activity  
4. Security sessions / recovery / alerts unavailable  
5. Connected dual surface with Command Center remains until product cutover  
6. Optional shared identity provider (dedupe Hero+Security hook) deferred to preserve freeze

## Future Extension Points

- Module 008 / 009 (mobile polish) if product requires  
- Passport-scoped activity & security producers  
- Shared Passport data provider for identity (read-only)  
- Command Center cutover below bottom grid  
- Liquidity valuation cutover when Liquidity portfolio fields are factual
